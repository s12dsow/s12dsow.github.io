DBC has a very intensive program and is divided into 4 phases. I will talk about my experience with phase 0. During that time, other than occasionally learning through codeacademy.com and other online resources, I had very minimal experience with programming. Phase 0 is divided into three units, and each unit lasts 3 weeks. 

In the first unit, we learned about Git, Github, the command line, HTML/CSS and we had an introduction to Ruby. In the second unit, we learned more about Ruby and Algorithms, Ruby classes and the concept of Object-Oriented Design. In the third unit, we started learning about Javascript and SQL. During my time with Phase 0, I had 2 jobs so I was extremely overwhelmed at the amount of additional work I had heaped on myself by deciding to take part in Dev Bootcamp.I became extremely aware of my time and became a lot better at time-management. Along with all the work given, we were also expected to pair with our cohort mates at least once or twice a week. I initially found that to be very annoying, because I just wanted to focus on myself and do everything by myself, but I quickly realized the value of working with others. Even though phase 0 was jam-packed with work, it was needed to prepare us for the upcoming phases.
