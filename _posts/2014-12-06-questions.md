Throughout phase 0, I have learned the importance of asking questions. Not just questions, but good questions. Every time I ran into an issue, I would go to google and had to tweak my questions to get the answers I was looking for. And due to this continuous tweaking, I have gotten a lot better at understanding the way to post questions so that I get the answers I am looking for. I have found that the more detailed and specific my question is, the more likely that I will get the answer I am looking for. I personally have not posted questions in the community group, but from looking at questions that have been posted as well as on sites such as stackoverflow, there are specific traits of a good question.

Personally for me, I think grammar, punctuation and good formatting make for easier readability. If I am looking at a question and it is very hard to read or too wordy, I will probably not bother with it. So the more clear and concise, the better. Also, if I see a question and it is too broad and not specific enough, it would be too much guesswork so may also not bother with it. Finally, including examples or code snippets that make it clear what is not working and specifically stating what is supposed to occur make it a lot more likely that you will get the answers.
