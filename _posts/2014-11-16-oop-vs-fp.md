Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming are two programming paradigms that are not dynamically opposed, as they do hold some similarities. But there are some very notable differences.

Object-Oriented Programming is a language model that is structured around objects, instead of actions. OOP manipulates objects to perform a task, and does so in relation to other objects. Once those objects have been identified, they are generalized as a class of objects, which then defines the data the object will contain and the behavior of the objects, or its methods. Objects are then able to communicate with other objects through messages. In OOP, encapsulation, or information-hiding, is a major concept, as it allows changes to be made to one object that does not affect the others.

On the other hand, Functional Programming originates from lambda calculus and instead of using objects like OOP does, it uses functions as its building blocks and like mathematical expressions, it declares a relationship between two or more things. Some of the main characteristics of FP include that data should be immutable and stateless. For example, if you wanted to modify existing data, you would have to create a new data structure with the updated values, and also, data should be performed with no indication of past performance. So functions will operate only with the arguments passed to it.

Though it seems that more people are moving in the direction of OO modeling, FP is still widely used and both languages hav	e their own strengths and weaknesses that make each better suited for certain tasks.
