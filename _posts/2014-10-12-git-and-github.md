As we all know, it is very easy to make mistakes when working on a project. And if you mess up when you are halfway through the project or even further, it can be extremely frustrating to try to retrace your steps to salvage your work. A great solution to this problem is version control. Version control allows you to work on a file and tracks your changes.

A popular version control software that is used is called Git. Git is lightweight and very simple to use. So as you are working away on your project, you can make a change and save that change and continue the process. When you feel satisfied with your changes, you can save, or commit. When you commit a file, you are creating a checkpoint that you can revert back to if something wrong happens with your main file.

Working hand in hand, Git and Github make a great team. Where Git provides the version control on your local computer, Github exists on the Internet and is a social platform where developers can share their work and collaborate on projects. Github is, in a sense, a hosting service where you can add your work. You and others can then view this code. So you work on your code locally, and then you can push, or add, your code to Github, as well as pull in changes made to code on Github back to your computer. Git and Github work very well for developers that are working on a project. And when collaborating with others, version control becomes even more important. Before I learned about Git, when I worked with others on projects, we would email files back and forth or use a flash drive. Now for a small scale project with two or three people, that might work. But it can easily get confusing, especially if more people are added to the mix or you are dealing with a larger project. Instead, Git provides a simple way to collaborate with others and keeps track of the history. Everyone can work on the same file at the same time. When you have made a change, you can send a pull request asking for others to review your code. And when everyone is happy with everything, you can merge those changes. Also if needed, you are able to find out who made changes and when those changes were made or even revert back to a prior version. So if you want to be a developer, you have to become familiar with what other developers are using out there. Understanding and using Git and Github is a great start!

Because I am a visual learner, I really enjoy interactive sites, and the two below were great at clarifying how to use Git:
