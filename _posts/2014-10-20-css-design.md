CSS has a lot of properties that can be used to style web pages. Among them include Margin, Border and Padding. Those are personally some of my favorite properties, given how simple they are to use and how effective they can be. Margin is used to define the space around an element. When you use it in your document, you can assign one value that will apply to the top, right, bottom and left margin. Or, for example, let us say you want to apply 5px to the top, 8px to the right, 6px to the bottom and 3px to the left. You would then declare to the element, margin: 5px 8px 6px 3px (order is top, right, bottom, left). Or you can also call on a specific side, such as margin-top or margin-right. When you adjust your margins, you are moving elements relative to the other elements as well as to the sides of your HTML document. While margin controls the space outside of an element, padding controls the space within an element. You can assign values the same way you would with margin. And finally, Border has a lot of neat properties. For example, if you want to add a 2px solid black colored line around an element, you would assign the border property: 2px solid black. Basically, it allows you to define a width, style and color to an element so it is very useful. I reference this chart a lot from codeacademy (who got it in turn from www.w3.org) when trying to understand these properties and their relation to the element:

When naming an element, you can use classes and ids. The idea is that we may need additional tags to target certain elements. Classes are used when you have several elements that all will have the same styling. You declare them within the HTML document and they are very useful so you do not have to keep repeating code to use the same styling on different elements. Ids then are used when you only have one element that needs to be styled. So whereas you can keep on using the same name for a class on an element within a document, a specific id name can only be assigned to one element and that element can only be assigned one id.

If you want to be able to move your elements a certain way on the page, it is important to understand positioning, as it allows you to position your elements. If you do not specify what type of positioning your element has, it will be defaulted to static. Static is just where your element would normally go in the document. It does not need to be specified. However, if you choose an absolute positioning, you are positioning your element in relation to its first parent element that does not have static positioning, or it will default back to the HTML element itself. This positioning allows you to place your element anywhere you want on the page. Relative positioning is when an element moves in relation to where it would have been had it been in static positioning. So it moves in relation to itself. Finally, fixed positioning freezes your element to your browser window. So if even if you scroll up and down, the element will remain fixed on the page.

Another useful property is display, which allows you to control the layout of your elements. Inline places elements in a single line, but they do not keep their dimensions. If you try setting a height and width, it will be ignored. In comparison, inline-block also places elements on the same line, but it maintains its dimensions and will accept height and width. There are many other properties that can be used. If you want further research on HTML and CSS properties, I would recommend going through codeacademy's track on HTML/CSS at [www.codeacademy.com](http://www.codeacademy.com)
