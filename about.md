My name is Dicko Sow and I have a BA in business. Prior to going to DevBootcamp, I worked in the insurance industry. Though I enjoyed what I did, I felt something was missing. At the time, I thought that maybe getting an MBA was a way to go, a way to fill that void. As I was researching MBA programs, I ran across an article that referenced a video on youtube called "What schools don't teach." That video literally changed my life. I was really curious as to why all these famous people were saying that everyone should learn how to code. And I am a very curious person. So I decided to find out what I was missing. I signed up on codeacademy and took the HTML/CSS course. And I literally fell in love. I knew that this is what I was missing in my life and I had to keep going.I especially liked it because it changed my thinking. Especially in college, I was always about getting a good grade, but not always about learning because I was interested. And I soon learned that with programming, you learn for yourself. You learn because you want to and there are so many paths you can go down with programming.  

Next, I took a course called online class called CS50, Intro to Computer Science hosted by Harvard and MIT. And right around that time, I started joining meetup groups where I was eventually introduced to the idea of bootcamps and Devbootcamp, in particular. I have never looked back. I am extremely excited about the future of technology and my place in it.
